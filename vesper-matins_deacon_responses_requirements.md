# Requirements for Deacons' Responses Document

## Overview
This project provides printable resources for all deacons' responses for the Coptic Vespers and Matins Raising of Incense. The responses are sourced from https://tasbeha.org/hymn_library/cat/220 and its linked pages.

## Files Created
- **vesper-matins_deacon_responses_requirements.md** (this file): Project requirements and documentation.
- **vesper-matins_deacon_responses_contents.md**: A compact 4-column table (English, Coptic, Arabic, Coptic English transliteration) with the main responses for quick reference and printing.
- **vesper-matins_deacon_responses_full.md**: A full 4-column table with the complete text of each response in all four languages/scripts, formatted for printability.

## How Content Was Gathered and Created
1. **Source**: All responses were collected from the official Coptic hymn library at https://tasbeha.org/hymn_library/cat/220 and its sub-links.
2. **Languages/Columns**:
  - English: Official translation or common liturgical English.
  - Coptic: Unicode Coptic script as found on the site.
  - Arabic: Official Arabic translation from the site.
  - Coptic English: Standard transliteration for pronunciation.
3. **Formatting**:
  - Markdown tables are used for compactness and printability.
  - The full file includes the complete text for each response, not just titles.
  - The contents file is a summary table for quick reference.
4. **Print Optimization**:
  - Designed to fit on two pages (use landscape orientation, small margins, and reduced font size if needed).
  - For best results, copy the table to a word processor for further layout control if required.

## Printing Instructions
- Use landscape orientation and adjust font size/margins as needed.
- For best results, print from a Markdown viewer or after copying to a word processor.
