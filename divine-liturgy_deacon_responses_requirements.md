# Divine Liturgy Deacon Responses Requirements

## Overview
This document describes the requirements and process for creating a printable, comprehensive set of deacon responses for the Coptic Divine Liturgy, using the structure and content from https://tasbeha.org/hymn_library/cat/203 and all its subpages.

## Files to be Created
- divine-liturgy_deacon_responses_requirements.md (this file)
- divine-liturgy_deacon_responses_contents.md (compact summary table)
- divine-liturgy_deacon_responses_full.md (full 4-column table)

## Source Structure
The Divine Liturgy is divided into:
- The Offertory (https://tasbeha.org/hymn_library/cat/222)
- The Liturgy of the Word (https://tasbeha.org/hymn_library/cat/204)
  - Deacon Responses: https://tasbeha.org/hymn_library/cat/207
- The Liturgy of the Believers (https://tasbeha.org/hymn_library/cat/205)
  - Deacon Responses: https://tasbeha.org/hymn_library/cat/227

## Process
1. Extract all deacon responses from the above sections and their subpages.
2. For each response, collect:
   - English
   - Coptic
   - Arabic
   - Coptic English transliteration
3. Create a compact summary table (contents file) listing all responses in 4 columns.
4. Create a full table (full file) with the complete text for each response in all 4 columns.
5. Format for printability (landscape, compact, clear font, minimal margins).

## Print Instructions
- Use landscape orientation for best fit.
- Adjust font size and margins for maximum content per page.
